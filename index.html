            <br><br> <b>Bauhaus Book cover no. 1</b>: I couldn't find a specific image with that name, so I included multiple pictures from the search results.
            <br><br> <b>Untitled Rayograph</b>: I'm 99% sure this is the right image. All of the rayographs look very similar.
            <br><br> <b>The World is Beautiful</b>: This is the name of a photo album. Because the photo's name wasn't provided, I used a photo of the album itself.
            <br><br> <b>The Face of Our Times</b>:	This is the name of a photo album. Because the photo's name wasn't provided, I used the most popular picture from the album. All of the images are very similar to the image shown.
            <br><br> <b>Return to Reason</b>: This is the name of a short film. I used the most popular frame.</div>
